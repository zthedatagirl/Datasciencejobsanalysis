In this project, I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis on a data science job dataset. In the course of the analysis, I answered the following questions: 
1. How many job title was included in the dataset?
2. Which experience level has the highest salary?
3. Does the employment type affect salary?
4. What is the average salary per job title in USD?
5. What is the highest salary per job title in USD?
6. What is the highest paying entry-level data science job?
7. What is the highest paying mid-level data science job?
8. What is the highest paying senior-level data science job?
9. What is the highest paying Executive level data science job?
10. What is the average salary per experience level?
11. What is the lowest paying entry-level data science job?
12. What is the lowest paying Mid-level Data Science Job?
13. What is the lowest paying Senior level data science job?
14. What is the lowest paying Executive level data science job?
15. Does company size affect salary?
16. Does company location affect Salary?
