## ABOUT
Data science is the domain of study that deals with vast volumes of data using modern tools and techniques to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make business decisions. Industries across the board have come to rely on data-driven insights as a way to guide their business strategy and execute day-to-day operations. Not surprising that data-related job roles and opportunities have mushroomed across the globe. Harvard Business Review calls the role of a data scientist as “the sexiest job of the 21st century”. Thus, it is important to know how much "the sexiest job" pays.

3. Does the employment type affect salary?
4. What is the average salary per job title in USD?
5. What is the highest salary per job title in USD?
6. What is the highest paying entry-level data science job?
7. What is the highest paying mid-level data science job?
8. What is the highest paying senior-level data science job?
9. What is the highest paying Executive level data science job?
10. What is the average salary per experience level?
11. What is the lowest paying entry-level data science job?
12. What is the lowest paying Mid-level Data Science Job?
13. What is the lowest paying Senior level data science job?
14. What is the lowest paying Executive level data science job?
